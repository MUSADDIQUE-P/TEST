            <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store

            <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in

                accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
                delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
                information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information

            <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to
                protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts
                to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
                technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
                cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
                improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect
                your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own
                risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

                take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data,

            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
            <p>Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which
                may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw
                your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the
                contact details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot;
                below.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal
                nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
                reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.&nbsp;</p>

                marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails
                that we send, replying &quot;STOP&quot; or &quot;UNSUBSCRIBE&quot; to the SMS messages that we send, or
                by contacting us using the details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS
                NOTICE?&quot; below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may &lsquo;still

                the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing
                purposes.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by
                default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject
                cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or
                services of our Services. To opt out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services you

            <p><strong>&nbsp;9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
                about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
                standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently
                respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
                be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we
                will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
            <p><strong>10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant
                laws.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
                &quot;Revised&quot; date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we
                make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice
                of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy
                notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
